# Space Invaders

The classic **Space Invaders** game written in Python and using Python module 'Pygame'.

Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship with lasers by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat four rows of ten aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen.
  The aliens attempt to destroy the ship by firing at it. As more aliens are defeated and as the round's progress, the aliens' movement speed up.
  
The ship is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers that are gradually destroyed by projectiles from the aliens and player.
